##Title - Screen Bounce
##Repository - https://github.com/lexielaviolette/Screen-Bounce.git 
     
##Description - This project will reference the pleasing and nostalgic bouncing screen savers of many of our childhoods, with a more colorful twist
##Features - There will be a little bouncing ball that will change dirretion and speed when hitting a wall. It will also have a gradual color shift
##Challenges - mouse click in pygame and color shift in python
##Outcomes - Software projects are infamously hard to predict effort. Itâ€™s actually common that one might accomplish less than hoped for. List down in 2-3 short sentences the below outcomes:
    ##1. Ideal Outcome - for the ball to change direction and speed when hitting a wall AND being pressed
    ##2. Minimal Viable Outcome - Get the ball to bounce and change colors
##Milestones - 1. get the ball to bounce off the walls 2. get the direction and speed to be random when hitting a wall 3. to get the colors to change 4. to get the speed and direction to change when the player cicks the circle
